# Cookitter

Cookitter from "cookie cutter" allows you to mirror elements from one artbook to another.

The use case is to aid the design of books with holes, holes needs to be mirrored from one side to the other side of the same page.

To allow Cookitter to work in your project some preparation is needed:

1. Create a layer called `cookitter` to hold your elements, or just run "Sync" for the first time!.

2. Artbooks that needs their elements to be mirrored should be name accordinly to this format: `CK-<page_number>-<side_lette>`.

   For example the first side of the first page should be called `CK-1-A` while the second side will be `CK-1-B`.
